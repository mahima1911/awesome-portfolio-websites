    abstract:
      "COVID-19 is an infectious disease that has been affecting millions of people across nations, leading to a pandemic. We study the impact of climatic conditions, fiscal and developmental indices, population parameters and environmental conditions of a country on COVID-19 spread. Using JHU CSSE COVID-19 time-series dataset, we find that while the north temperate zone shows the highest increase in confirmed cases and deaths, the tropical zone has shown the highest recovery rate. The polar zone is negligibly affected by the virus. The correlation between number of cases and gross domestic product is 0.91. The Cases Per Population (CPP) and the countryâ€™s human development index show an unexpected positive correlation of 0.73. There is a negligible correlation of -0.11 between population density and the total cases. The correlation between urban population percent and CPP is 0.58. A weak correlation of 0.23 is obtained between urban particulate matter and total cases. <br> Keywords: COVID-19, zones, gross domestic product, human development index, population density, urban population percent, particulate matter, regression, correlation",
